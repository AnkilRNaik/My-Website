                    <p align="justify">I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from New Jersey Institute of Technology, New Jersey, United States. Having graduated in December 2016, I joined Perficient as an Associate Technical Consultant in March 2017. I also did an internship at Forbes in the summer of 2016 where I worked as a Software Engineering Intern; along with that I was also concurrently working under Dr. James Geller (Department of Computer Science, NJIT) as a Research Team Member from January 2016 to December 2016. I have also worked as a Software Engineer for about a year before moving here to the United States. Although, I am a little inclined towards Java I enjoy playing with Javascript, AngularJS to name a few. I am a dedicated, hard working individual and have a passion to learn new technologies. My strengths lie in my multitasking abilities, communication skills, and flexibility in working in a team. I am a huge admirer of sports and I love playing video games in my spare time.</p>
